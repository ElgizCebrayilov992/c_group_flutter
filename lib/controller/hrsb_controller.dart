THEATRUM Hotel is located on the main street of Baku Nizami Street. The street's history could be traced back to Baku's town-planning project of 1864. The street runs through the city's downtown from west to east.

The history of the building is closely related with Azerbaijan State Russian Samed Vurgun Drama Theatre located in front of the hotel. The performances of the theatre are mainly from the Russian works of art and literature, and the remainder are performances from Azerbaijani and European classical writers.
